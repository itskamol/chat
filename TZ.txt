Okay, this is a significant task! Creating a full-fledged Technical Specification (TZ), also often known as a Software Requirements Specification (SRS), is a detailed process. I will provide a comprehensive TZ based on our discussion, aiming to cover as many "small details" as possible.

This document will be structured according to common SRS/TZ practices.

1. Introduction
1.1. Purpose

This document specifies the technical requirements and architectural design for migrating the existing chat application's backend from its current technology stack to a modern, scalable, and maintainable microservices architecture based on NestJS. The primary goal is to improve system performance, developer productivity, scalability, and resilience.

1.2. Scope

In Scope:

Complete backend rewrite and migration to NestJS.

Decomposition of the existing monolithic backend (or existing services) into the defined microservices.

Implementation of an API Gateway for client-backend interaction.

Integration of asynchronous messaging (RabbitMQ) and synchronous communication (gRPC) between services.

Preservation of existing WebRTC (Mediasoup) functionality, with signaling handled by a new NestJS service.

Database strategy implementation ("Database per Service" as the target).

Setup of CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, logging, and tracing for the new architecture.

Adherence to security best practices.

Out of Scope:

Changes to the existing Next.js frontend UI. The new backend API must remain compatible or be adapted via the API Gateway.

Major new feature development beyond what is required for the migration and architectural improvements.

Migration of historical Mediasoup media stream data (if any). Focus is on signaling and session management.

Desktop/mobile client application changes (unless API contract necessitates minor updates).

File sharing and management.

Real-time audio/video communication via WebRTC (Mediasoup).

Push and in-app notifications.

2.3. User Characteristics

The primary users interacting with this backend system (indirectly, via clients) are end-users of the chat application.
Direct interactors with the system (for development, deployment, maintenance) include:

Backend Developers

Frontend Developers (consuming APIs)

DevOps Engineers

System Administrators

4.3. Microservice Descriptions (Recap)

Gateway: Single entry point, routing, auth, WS management.

User Service: User identity, profiles, authentication.

Chat Service: Chat room logic, real-time event coordination.

Message Service: Message persistence and retrieval.

Presence Service: User online/offline/typing status.

File Service: File upload/download, metadata management.

Media Service: WebRTC/Mediasoup signaling.

Notification Service: Push and in-app notifications.

4.4. Inter-service Communication Strategy

Used for event-driven decoupling and non-blocking operations.

Examples: UserCreatedEvent from user-service consumed by notification-service. NewMessagePersistedEvent from message-service consumed by chat-service (to then broadcast via WS).

Guaranteed delivery (persistent messages) and dead-letter queues (DLQs) for reliability.

Used for direct request/response interactions where an immediate answer is needed.

High-performance, type-safe communication using Protocol Buffers.

Examples: gateway calling user-service to validate credentials. chat-service calling message-service to fetch message history.

4.5. API Gateway Pattern

As detailed in Functional Requirements (3.1.1) and Architecture (4.3). It centralizes cross-cutting concerns and simplifies client interaction.

4.6. Database Strategy (Database per Service)

Goal: Each microservice owns its data and database.

user-service: PostgreSQL (relational data, transactions).

message-service: MongoDB (flexible schema, high write throughput, good for chat messages).

presence-service: Redis (fast key-value store for ephemeral state).

file-service: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for metadata.

Other services: Choose DB based on specific needs (e.g., PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for flexible documents).

Migration Phase: Initially, some services might share a database or collections if immediate separation is too complex, with a clear roadmap to full separation. An Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) might be used if new services read from old DB structures.

5. Migration Strategy
5.1. Overall Approach: Strangler Fig Pattern

Gradually replace parts of the old system with new microservices. The API Gateway plays a crucial role in routing traffic to either the old system or new services.

5.2. Phased Rollout

Infrastructure Setup: Monorepo, CI/CD, base Docker images, RabbitMQ, initial DBs.

Core Service Migration: Start with user-service and authentication. Implement in API Gateway.

Chat & WebSocket Migration: chat-service, message-service, presence-service. Integrate WebSocket handling in API Gateway.

Specialized Services: file-service, media-service (signaling), notification-service.

Testing & Optimization: Thorough E2E testing, performance tuning.

Decommission Old System: Once all functionality is migrated and stable.

5.3. Parallel Run

New services will run in parallel with the old system. The API Gateway will initially route all traffic to the old system. As new services become ready, traffic for specific functionalities will be rerouted.

5.4. Traffic Routing via API Gateway

The API Gateway will be configured to route requests based on path, headers, or feature flags.

Example: /api/v1/users might initially go to the old system. After user-service is ready, the Gateway routes /api/v1/users (or a new /api/v2/users) to the NestJS user-service.

Feature flags can be used for A/B testing or gradual rollout to a percentage of users.

5.5. Data Handling during Migration

Option 1 (Preferred if feasible): New services own new data. Data from old system is migrated to new databases in batches or via a one-time cutover for each service.

Option 2 (Interim): New services read/write to existing database (via ACL if schema is different) until data migration is complete. This increases risk and coupling.

Data Synchronization: If dual-write is necessary (writing to both old and new DBs for a period), implement robust synchronization mechanisms and reconciliation processes. This is complex and should be avoided if possible.

5.6. Rollback Strategy

For each migrated piece of functionality, a clear rollback plan MUST exist. This typically involves reconfiguring the API Gateway to route traffic back to the old system component. Automated scripts for rollback SHOULD be prepared.

6. Technology Stack

Backend Framework: NestJS (Node.js, TypeScript)

Monorepo Tool: NX (Nrwl Extensions)

Language: TypeScript

Databases:

PostgreSQL (for relational data, e.g., User Service)

MongoDB (for document data, e.g., Message Service)

Redis (for caching, presence, session management)

Asynchronous Messaging: RabbitMQ

Synchronous Inter-service Communication: gRPC (with Protocol Buffers)

Real-time Communication (Client-Server): WebSockets (Socket.IO adapter for NestJS)

7. Development and Operational Environment (DevOps)
7.1. Version Control

Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). Branching strategy: GitFlow or a simpler trunk-based development with feature branches.

7.2. Containerization

Each microservice SHALL have its own Dockerfile optimized for production (multi-stage builds).

docker-compose.yml SHALL be provided for easy local development and testing environment setup.

7.3. Orchestration (Target)

Kubernetes (K8s) is the target orchestration platform for production deployments for scalability, resilience, and service discovery. Alternatives: AWS ECS, Docker Swarm (if K8s is overkill initially).

7.4. CI/CD Pipeline

(e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)

Trigger: On every push to main/develop branches and for pull requests.

Stages:

Linting & Static Analysis

Unit Tests (NX affected:test)

Integration Tests (NX affected:test)

Build Docker Images (NX affected:build)

Push Images to Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR, GCR)

Security Scan (image vulnerabilities, dependency check)

Deploy to Staging Environment

Run E2E Tests on Staging

(Manual/Automated) Deploy to Production

7.5. Configuration Management

NestJS ConfigModule using .env files for environment-specific configurations.

No hardcoded secrets or configurations in code.

Configuration validation using Joi or class-validator.

7.6. Secrets Management

HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Kubernetes Secrets for managing database credentials, API keys, JWT secrets, etc.

7.7. Logging

Structured logging (JSON format) using Pino or Winston.

Logs from all services SHALL be aggregated into a centralized logging platform (e.g., ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana; or Grafana Loki).

Correlation IDs SHALL be used to trace requests across multiple services.

7.8. Monitoring and Alerting

Metrics: Prometheus for collecting metrics from each service (e.g., request rates, error rates, latency, resource usage via prom-client).

Dashboards: Grafana for visualizing metrics.

Alerting: Alertmanager (integrated with Prometheus) or Grafana Alerting for notifying on critical issues (e.g., high error rates, service unavailability, resource exhaustion).

Health Checks: Each microservice MUST expose a /health endpoint for liveness and readiness probes (used by orchestrators like Kubernetes).

7.9. Tracing

Distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry with an exporter to Jaeger or Zipkin. This is crucial for understanding request flows and debugging performance issues in a microservices architecture.

9. Risk Assessment and Mitigation
Risk ID	Description	Likelihood	Impact	Mitigation Strategy
R-001	Incompatibility with existing frontend API	Medium	High	Thorough API contract analysis. API Gateway transformation layer. Prioritize backward compatibility. Frequent communication with frontend team.
R-002	Data migration issues (loss, corruption)	Medium	High	Detailed data migration plan. Dry runs. Backups before migration. Validation scripts. Phased data migration.
R-003	Performance degradation in new system	Medium	High	Early performance testing (load tests). Profiling. Database query optimization. Scalable infrastructure design.
R-004	Extended downtime during cutover	Low	High	Strangler Fig pattern to minimize big-bang cutovers. Blue/Green or Canary deployments. Detailed rollback plans.
R-005	Lack of team expertise in new technologies	Medium	Medium	Training, workshops. Pair programming. Hire experienced consultants if needed. Start with less critical services.
R-006	Inter-service communication failures	Medium	Medium	Implement resilience patterns (retries, timeouts, circuit breakers). Robust monitoring and alerting for service health. gRPC deadliness.
R-007	Scope creep / underestimated complexity	High	High	Strict scope management. Prioritize core migration over new features. Detailed breakdown of tasks. Regular review of progress and estimates.
R-008	Security vulnerabilities introduced	Medium	High	Adhere to security best practices. Code reviews focused on security. Dependency scanning. Penetration testing before full launch.
R-009	Issues with Mediasoup integration	Medium	Medium	Isolate Mediasoup signaling logic. Thorough testing of WebRTC flows. Leverage existing Mediasoup expertise if available.
R-010	RabbitMQ message loss or processing errors	Low	Medium	Persistent messages, publisher confirms, consumer acknowledgments. Dead-letter queues (DLQs) and monitoring of DLQs. Idempotent consumers.
10. Glossary (Extended)

Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL): A software layer that translates between two different systems or parts of a system (e.g., new microservice and old database schema).

Circuit Breaker: A design pattern used in microservices to detect failures and prevent a recurring failure from constantly trying to execute, which could lead to system-wide issues.

Dead Letter Queue (DLQ): In messaging systems like RabbitMQ, a queue where messages are sent if they cannot be processed successfully by a consumer.

Feature Flag: A technique that allows parts of a program to be turned on or off remotely without deploying new code.

Idempotent Consumer: A message consumer that can safely process the same message multiple times without unintended side effects.

Liveness Probe: A check used by orchestrators (like Kubernetes) to determine if an application instance is running. If it fails, the instance is restarted.

Readiness Probe: A check used by orchestrators to determine if an application instance is ready to accept traffic. If it fails, the instance is not sent new requests.

Saga Pattern: A way to manage data consistency across microservices in distributed transactions using a sequence of local transactions.

Strangler Fig Pattern: An architectural approach to incrementally migrating a legacy system by gradually replacing specific pieces of functionality with new applications and services.

TURN/STUN Servers: Servers used in WebRTC to facilitate NAT traversal and enable peer-to-peer connections.
