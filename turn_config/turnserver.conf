# External IP address of the server.
# For local Docker setup, this can be tricky.
# If your Docker host has a known IP accessible by clients, use that.
# Alternatively, coturn can try to auto-detect if behind NAT,
# or you might need to set this to the IP of your Nginx proxy if TURN is routed via it.
# For now, let's assume coturn attempts auto-detection or this is manually set later.

# Realm for TURN authentication
realm=chat.example.com

# Static user for TURN authentication (for simplicity in this setup)
# Format: user=password
user=turnuser:turnpassword

# Log file
log-file=/dev/stdout # Log to stdout to be captured by Docker logs
# Or use a file: log-file=/var/log/turnserver.log

# Specify the relay port range if needed by clients,
# otherwise coturn uses a default range (49152-65535)

# max-port=65535

# Verbose logging (optional)

# Other security settings (optional for now)
